Current project: Odin Recipes
Skills - working with HTML to build a basic webpage
Will consist of main index page and links to a few recipes
Update after finishing the lesson: I'm getting familiar with HTML and building the basic of the web page. I need to still get familiar with the git process. That's a little foggy to me but I believe with more practice, I will understand it more and more. #
